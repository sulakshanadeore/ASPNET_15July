State Management
-----------------

Web applications----- http/https
Both these protocols are stateless protocols.
ie. donot remember anything about the previous request, 
unless u explicitly do some steps/techniques.
These steps to make the page/application remember the state(data)
of the control/page/app is called state management.

Techniques:
1) Client--- ViewState,cookies,QueryStrings,hidden fields
2) Server----- Sesion,Application,Profiles

Client Side
------------

1) ViewState--- 
to make remember the data for a same page.
uses Dictionary 
--------------------------------
to Carry data from one page to another page we use cookies or query string.

2) Cookies---  text files that store the data on the browser.
single value/multi valued
single valued cookie
multivalued cookie

a cookie is persisted till it doesn't expire.

Advantage---- data can be transferred easily from one page to another page
disadvantage----- risky
           ---------size limitation to the cookie.
every browser has a cookie limit.
max number of cookies 
180 cookies----max size 4096 bytes

localStorage---- can be used

3) Query String---- with ?(question mark)
disadvantage-- risky and size of 2048 characters limit

4) hidden string
